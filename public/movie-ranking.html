<h1>Gabriele's best movies (all-time)</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies you will like for sure as I have the best taste ever</h2>
<hr>
<h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
<p>Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.</p>
<h3>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</h3>
<p>This is just symbolic because every movie by Lanthimos is a work of art. And when I say art I mean A-R-T.</p>
<h3>Marsala a Mano Armata</h3>
<p>THIS must be the best movie ever. It launched the career of the most handsome and talented actor who ever existed in this plan- I mean, universe: myself.</p>
